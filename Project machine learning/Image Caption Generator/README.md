Image Caption Generator | Deep Learning Project

This project focuses on generating accurate and meaningful captions for images using Deep Learning. It integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting visual features and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating descriptive captions. The model is trained using the Flickr8k dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to automatically describe images using natural language. This technology has several practical applications:
Assisting visually impaired individuals by describing surroundings.
*Enhancing content discovery in media libraries
*Auto-captioning images on social media and cloud storage platforms
*Improving image search relevance

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This project utilizes an Encoder–Decoder architecture:

Component	Description
Encoder	Pre-trained CNN extracts visual features
Decoder	LSTM-based language model generates captions
Embeddings	Word embeddings created from vocabulary
Optimization	Teacher forcing + categorical crossentropy
Optional	Beam search for improved sentence generation
## 📊 Dataset — Flickr8k

8586 real-world images

40455 total text captions

Contains humans and animals in various activities

Due to size restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.
Place the images and captions inside a dataset/ directory after downloading.
